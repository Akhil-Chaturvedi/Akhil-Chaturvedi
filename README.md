# Hai, I'm Akhil

I'm currently a first-year college student, diving into Computer Science with a focus on Cybersecurity. I'll be hitting 17 this November! While my major points towards cybersecurity, I'm genuinely curious about *everything* in computing, especially when it comes to the wild world of Artificial Intelligence.

## What gets me going:

 **Spotting a gap and building a bridge:** My favorite thing to do is find a problem where the right tool just doesn't exist – and then I get to build it myself! From apps to web apps and custom tools, pretty much all my projects started because I felt like something was missing.

 **AI's my co-pilot (and fascination!):** Yep, I use AI to help me code. As someone who's always learning, it's been an incredible partner for exploring ideas and speeding up my projects. Plus, the whole field of AI just excites me!

 **Giving back to the open-source world:** I spend a lot of time poking around other people's code to learn, and I think it's super important to contribute back. That's why I love working on open-source projects that can actually help others in the community.

## What I'm focused on right now:

*   Messing around with AI and Machine Learning in different ways.
*   Building cool open-source stuff that makes a difference.
*   Digging deeper into how cybersecurity really works.
